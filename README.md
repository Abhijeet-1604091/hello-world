# hello-world

It is my first repository in Github. I came to know about Github from the course named "The Data Scientist's Toolbox" from Johns Hopkins University.

My name is Abhijeet Acharjee Jeet. I am trying to learn Git & Github to use it for my convenience while doing works in Rstudio. I am excited to learn about it.

I am making some edits in this file to learn about branching and version control. The 5th and 7th line is extra addition.
